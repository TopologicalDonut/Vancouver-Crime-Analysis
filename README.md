# Vancouver Crime Analysis

This repository contains the raw code for my [analysis](https://topologicaldonut.github.io/posts/Vancouver_DST/) of how daylight savings time affects crime in Vancouver. 

`Code\data_cleaning.R` contains code that was used to create `Data\Processed\merged_data_clean.csv`, which is the cleaned data used for this analysis. It is not necessary to run -- `Code\script.R` contains all the code for analysis.
